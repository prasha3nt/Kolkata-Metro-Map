# Kolkata-Metro-Map

This application will find you the shortest path between two Metro stations of Kolkata Metro.
It will also calculate the fare for that journey. This Project was created with the help of 
Graph Data Structure and Dijkstra's algorithm was used to find the shortest distance between
source and destination station.

Thanks for visiting this project. Do fork and create a better version of it or you can replicate it
with Metro Map of your city.
